    "The Muskingum-Cunge (MC) model is a kinematic wave approximation of the St. Venant equations with parameters based on channel characteristics. The model is coded in Fortran and frequently called by Python scripts in the t-route repository. This notebook demonstrates the application of the MC model. The notebook reviews how to create an extension module that allows Fortran functions to be called by Python, how to set up the model domain, specify river segment parameters, execute the model, and evaluate output. Model application is reviewed in the context of two simple experiments.\n",

    "First, we need to add the single-segment Fortran routing directory to the system path. To use Fortran routing subroutines, we need to tell the system where they are located. We do this by adding new directories to the path. We have some logic to accomodate execution in Google Colaboratory notebooks, as needed."
