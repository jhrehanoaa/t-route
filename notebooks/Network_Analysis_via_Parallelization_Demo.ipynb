    "## NHD Network Analysis Demo\n",
    "___TL;DR___: *We are trying to parallelize hydraulic calculations for dynamic subsets of the U.S. river and stream network*<br><br>\n",
    "The following was developed as part of the process of preparing a method for forecasting flows on the US network of rivers and streams as represented in the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD is a continuously evolving characterization of a fractal system so we felt that we needed to plan to have some flexibility. We hope to identify the complexity inherent in the network at different levels of resolution and we hope to be able to do so dynamically. The goal is also to be able to manage the complexity calculation for arbitrary collections of headwater points, such as might be obtained from a list of named streams or during a major flood event in a particular region.<br>\n",
    "As a point of terminology, we use the word 'routing' as shorthand to refer to the computation of the translation of a particular flow condition, high or low, to downstream (or in some cases upstream) areas of influence.\n",
    "The network complexity is related to the potential for parallelization of a serial analysis of the network. We have identified three levels of parallelization that may be implemented: \n",
    "1. System-level parallelization of independent networks -- the routing computations for the Mississippi River have little (nothing, except conceptual similarity and a shared existence on earth) to do with the computations for the Columbia river for any practical level of analysis. The system of networks across the US is what we are considering in general.\n",
    "1. Network-level parallelization of interconnected reaches -- There is a need to consider the computations for adjacent branches within a network of con-flowing streams, but with proper ordering, some of the computations may be considered in parallel. For example, the Illinois River headwaters and the Mississippi River headwaters are related within their broader Mississippi network, but the routing calculations for those headwaters are pratically agnostic to one another.\n",
    "1. Reach-level parallelization of the specific routing computation -- the numerical work of routing water downstream is a matrix computation and consists of exploring solutions to differential equations, all of which may potentially be examined in parallel, under the proper conditions and with suitable assumptions.<br>\n"

    "For the 14351 independent networks (and 2.7M segments) of the NWM Full Resolution dataset on a Google colaboratory VM, the algorithm steps through the segments of the different independent networks in order in about 4 seconds, regardless of the parallelization method. On a modest workstation at NWC with 12 cores, the compute time was approximately 2 seconds for a serial compute and 1.1 seconds for each of the parallel methods. Notably, because we are only breaking apart the independent networks, the maximum parallel speedup is limited by the size of the largest network -- the Mississippi River. By executing with the terminal node for the Mississippi River removed from the evaluation set, the serial calculation takes only 1.4 seconds and the parallel executions drop to approximately 0.4 seconds.<br>\n",
