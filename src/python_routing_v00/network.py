    Any collection of networks, above the level of strict hydraulic connectivity,
    begins to be a human artifact and potentially arbitrary.
    Nonetheless, there may be cases where this is sensible, such as in the case
    of the Missississippi River SuperNetwork (with at least Missouri, Red,
    Arkansas, Illinois, and Ohio as contained networks.) Likewise, one could group
    all continental rivers, or rivers on either side of the continental divide,
    etc. In any case, this designation will almost always be manually applied,
    and in the test case, the SuperNetwork is simply the collection of all networks
